## Test Commands
The HelloWorld program is intended to verify that the Java environment is set up correctly and to demonstrate a basic program structure. There are no complex test cases for this simple example, but you can verify its functionality by:  

- Running the Program:
```Java
Ensure that "Hello World!" is printed correctly. 
```
- Modifying the Message: 
```Java
Try changing the string in System.out.println to see if the program correctly reflects the new message.
```
